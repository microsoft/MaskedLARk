## Masked LARk Helper Service

This folder is intended to provide quickstart code to implementing a helper service with capabilities that are outlined in the MaskedLark proposal.

The code here can be used as an Azure Function App without additional modification. However, note that different helpers should have unique endpoints and unique names. The helper name is whatever is specified in helpername.txt.
